            Fishmeal is a product that is used to feed farm animals 
            and some marine animals. It is mainly made from anchovies or other small fish. 
            It's popularity around the world is due to it's high levels of protein and availability. 
            For years now, Peru has led all countries in the production and exportation of fishmeal. 
            In the fishing industry, fish are caught for two distinct purposes. They are caught for direct 
            human consumption (canned, frozen, fresh) or for indirect human consumption (fishmeal, fish oil). 
            About 83% of all fish caught in Peru in 2008 were for indirect human consumption which totaled more 
            than 6 million metric tons.[1] The vast majority of fishmeal production comes from Chimbote, a city north of Lima 
            with the biggest port in the world. Although the fishmeal industry has created jobs for many people and 
            contributes millions of dollars to the Peruvian economy, it has had some negative effects. Due to the 
            many factories that have been built around the city, residents of Chimbote have seen increased levels of pollution. 
            Once a tourist attraction, the beaches are now filled with garbage and dirty water. If the fishmeal industry wants 
            to survive, it must learn to adapt to a changing world.

              For years now, Peru has been the leading producer of fishmeal, 
              due to their rich anchovy population. In 2020, it is estimated they will have 
              produced about 1,100,000 metric tons of fishmeal around the world, more than the EU
              and Viet Nam combined. If Peru is the unofficial exporter of fishmeal, China is the unofficial importer of it. 80% 
              of Peru's fishmeal export is destined for China. In 2019, China imported an estimated 
              1.9 million metric tons of fishmeal.[2]

              Peru experienced a boom in fishmeal production during the 1960's. It's demand around 
              the world increased sharply and people rushed to Chimbote to take advantage of new opportuntites. 
              A study done in 1965 concluded that about 60% of residents of Chimbote had moved from other parts of the country.[3]
              In 1967, Peru exported more than 2 million metric tons of fishmeal, almost double the amount from 2020. 
              However, the largest amount of fishmeal export in a year came in 1999 when they exported 
              more than 2.3 million metric tons of fishmeal. While Peru's fishmeal industry 
              is the largerst one in the world, it has gone through periods of difficulties, especially in 1972.

              Peru's fishmeal industry has dealt with rough times in the past. One of the 
              biggest threats to the industry in the El Niño phenomenon. El Niño causes an increase 
              in ocean water temperatures, particularly in the surface. This makes anchovies harder to catch since they 
              swim deeper in the ocean. Peru was hit with one of the worst El Niños in history. 
              It's exportation in 1972 went down almost 80% from the previous year. The industry took years 
              to recover from this disaster. It did not export more than 1 million metric tons of fishmeal until 1988, 
              15 years after El Niño hit. It was hit with another on in 1982 and 1997 when their exports decreased 
              by 66% and 69%, respectively.

            <h3>
              El Niño is probably the greatest threat to the fishmeal industry. While this is a naturally occurring phenomenon, 
              climate change has affected how strong the disasters are. If the earths temperature keeps increasing, the temperature of ocean waters 
              will also increase. This could force the migration of certain species. The disappearance of anchovies in the Chimbote oceans could 
              be devastating not only for Peru's economy but also the many people that depend on the industry for their source of income. <br>
              El Niño not only affects oceans temperature. It can also cause other disasters to occur, such as droughts, floods, and hurricanes.[4]
              In the 1972 El Niño, Chimbote residents lost their homes and some even lost their lives because of major floods. It is estimated that during the 1997 El Niño,
              360 people died because of it and more than 100,000 homes were destroyed.[5] Some indirect causes of El Niño include the increase of diseases 
              such as cholera, malaria, and dengue. Peru suffered an increase of 42,000 cases of cholera in 1998, a year after El Niño started.[6]

              The pollution caused by the many factories that produce fishmeal will also hurt the fishmeal industry in the long run. The pollution created by 
              the factories is contributing to climate change. As mentioned above, those changes to the climate will affect the anchovie population. The well-being and 
              quality of life of the residents should also be taken into account. All the money that fishmeal brings into Chimbote will not matter if the 
              people living there cannot breath clean air or drink clean water. <br>
              Maria Elena Foronda Farro, now a congresswoman represting Chimbote, fought for years during the 90's for her city and its residents. She was successful in 
              making businesses adopt more environmentally-friendly practices to reduce the contamination of the ocean.[7] However, she was jailed after being 
              accused of having ties to the Shining Path terrorist organization. She was freed after 13 months due to lack of evidence. Many believe 
              she was falsely accused because of her fight against the fishmeal industry.
